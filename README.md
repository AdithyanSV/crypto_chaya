### Project Description
CryptoChayakkada takes users back to the charm of an 80s Kerala tea shop. Step into a virtual “chayakkada” where the tea-seller offers classic delights like tea, egg puffs, samosas, and crispy vadas—all available for purchase with simulated cryptocurrency. Users can activate an old-school radio to enjoy timeless Malayalam songs, accompanied by the subtle sounds of tea being brewed and poured. The nostalgic environment and simple joys of an 80s Kerala tea shop are recreated with love, blending culture with technology in a lighthearted experience.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world full of cutting-edge, meaningful tech, the need for a crypto-powered, 80s-themed Kerala chayakkada simulator has been, shockingly, nonexistent—until now. CryptoChayakkada lets users spend cryptocurrency on virtual tea and snacks, listen to retro Malayalam songs, and experience the cozy, irrelevant charm of tea-making sounds. It’s a perfectly pointless tribute to simpler times, proving that, sometimes, the most useless ideas are the most fun.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing the Ultimate Chayakkada Simulator: an online 80’s Kerala tea stall experience, complete with a virtual tea seller accepting cryptocurrency for items like tea, egg puffs, samosas, and vadas. Users can wastefully "spend" crypto, listen to classic Malayalam songs, and savor the comforting hiss of tea brewing—all from their screens, with no real-world impact. It's an answer to a problem no one had, designed purely to bask in nostalgia, spend imaginary money, and add zero value to daily life.
